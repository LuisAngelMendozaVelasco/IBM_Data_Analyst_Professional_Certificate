# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this module, you will learn what is meant by exploratory data analysis, and you will learn how to perform computations on the data to calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data. You will learn about putting your data into groups to help you visualize the data better, you will learn how to use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables, and you will learn how to use the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement descriptive statistics
- Demonstrate the basics of grouping
- Describe data correlation processes
- Describe why and how to apply the Chi-Squared test
