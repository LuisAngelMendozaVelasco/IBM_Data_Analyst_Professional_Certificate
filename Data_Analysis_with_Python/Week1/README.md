# Importing Datasets

In this module, you will learn how to understand data and learn about how to use the libraries in Python to help you import data from multiple sources. You will then learn how to perform some basic tasks to start exploring and analyzing the imported data set.

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze Python data using a dataset
- Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses
- Read data using Python's Pandas package
- Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python
