# Gathering and Wrangling Data

In this module, you will learn about the process and steps involved in identifying, gathering, and importing data from disparate sources. You will learn about the tasks involved in wrangling and cleaning data in order to make it ready for analysis. In addition, you will gain an understanding of the different tools that can be used for gathering, importing, wrangling, and cleaning data, along with some of their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the steps and processes you need to take to identify, gather, and import data from disparate sources.
