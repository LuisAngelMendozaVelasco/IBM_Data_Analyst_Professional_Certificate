# Mining & Visualizing Data and Communicating Results

In this module, you will learn about the role of Statistical Analysis in mining and visualizing data. You will learn about the various statistical and analytical tools and techniques you can use in order to gain a deeper understanding of your data. These tools help you to understand the patterns, trends, and correlations that exist in data. In addition, you will learn about the various types of data visualizations that can help you communicate and tell a compelling story with your data. You will also gain an understanding of the different tools that can be used for mining and visualizing data, along with some of their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how statistical tools and techniques can help create a deeper understanding of what the data means.
- Describe the tools and processes used for mining and analyzing data to understand the patterns, trends, and correlations that exist in the data.
- Explain how to choose the best visualization for your data and the possibilities offered by some of the most popular data visualization and dashboarding tools.
- Summarize how you can tell a compelling and convincing story with your data.
