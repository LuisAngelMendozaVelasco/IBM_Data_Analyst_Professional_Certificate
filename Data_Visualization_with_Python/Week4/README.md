# Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash

In this module you will get started with dashboard creation using the Plotly library. You will create a dashboard with a theme `US Domestic Airline Flights Performance`. You will do this using a US airline reporting carrier on-time performance dataset, Plotly, and Dash concepts learned throughout the course. Hands-on labs will follow each concept to make you comfortable with using the library. Reading lists will reference additional resources to learn more about the concepts covered.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify high-level popular Python dashboarding tools.
- Demonstrate basic Plotly, Plotly.graph_objects, and Plotly express commands.
- Demonstrate using Dash and basic Dash components (core and HTML).
- Demonstrate adding different dashboard elements including text boxes, dropdown, graphs, and others.
- Apply interactivity to dash core and HTML components.
- Describe how a dashboard can be used to answer critical business questions.
